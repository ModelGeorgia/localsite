# Location Map Filters 

1.) [countries.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite/tree/main/info/data/map-filters) for our [country selection filters](#geoview=countries) and [tabulator sample](/data-pipeline/timelines/training/naics/)

2.) [us-states.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite/tree/main/info/data/map-filters) for our [state selection filters](#geoview=country) probably generated by one of these CoLabs (Abhishek L):

<!--
Not needed since we're pulling from GDC instead:
Copy population lookups [from this CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wmJ3V9eqD8KbmBiP-hLeSstwOUt5iS2V?usp=sharing) using python libraries.
-->

DONE: Output countries.csv file with 2-char country codes and similar columns to [us-states.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite/blob/main/info/data/map-filters/us-states.csv). - Abhishek L


TO DO: Create a GitHub Action for our [State Filters CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CsIjLujiiBoGJlIHCBvDZit3QSVg07zR?usp=sharing).  
Run annually for both states and countries.

DONE: Document how to add a private Github token to push from CoLab. Documented below. - Ivy

Delete: [us-states.json](/localsite/info/data/map-filters/us-states.json) (replaced with us-states.csv)
Delete: [country-populations.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite/blob/main/info/data/map-filters/country-populations.csv) which used 3-char.


## Previous: State Carbon Comparison

Data merged for [Carbon Cycle - State Comparison](/apps/carbon/#state=CA) within apps/js/bc.js

The original BeyondCarbon.org state comparison data seems to be removed from their site.

[BeyondCarbon.org](https://BeyondCarbon.org) data was originally pulled into [fused/result.json](https://model.earth/beyond-carbon-scraper/fused/result.json) by [beyond-carbon-scraper](https://github.com/modelearth/beyond-carbon-scraper/)
