# For Location Map Filters 

[View state filters (above)](#geoview=country)

We're generating .CSV files displayed using tabulator to the left of filter maps.

In our [State Filters colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CsIjLujiiBoGJlIHCBvDZit3QSVg07zR?usp=sharing) - we geneate a state .csv file and send to Github.

**TO DO:** Add info on how to enter a private GitHub token in State Filters CoLab.

We're replacing [us-states.json](/localsite/info/data/map-filters/us-states.json) with a CSV file. (Link coming soon)

Not needed since we're pulling from GDC instead:

# UN Goal Topics

Our [Google Sheet with Goal tabs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IGyvcMV5wkGaIWM5dyB-vQIXXZFJUMV3WRf_UmyLkRk/edit?usp=sharing) for DCID values fed to our Python .csv file generation. - Abhishek L. and Pratyush  

Goal .csv file output is initially in local notebooks, later in this [UN Goals CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1riRnKUGNGkJZOU6qJoznAxjySInQjnFQ?usp=sharing).


From the sheet columsn, display a clean navigation hierarchy with 3 levels:

## Previous: State Carbon Comparison

Data merged for [Carbon Cycle - State Comparison](/apps/carbon/#state=CA) within apps/js/bc.js

The original BeyondCarbon.org state comparison data seems to be removed from their site.

[BeyondCarbon.org](https://BeyondCarbon.org) data was originally pulled into [fused/result.json](https://model.earth/beyond-carbon-scraper/fused/result.json) by [beyond-carbon-scraper](https://github.com/modelearth/beyond-carbon-scraper/)
